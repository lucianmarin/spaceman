        Hello, I'm <span itemprop="name">Lucian Marin</span>. <span itemprop="description">I have a background in electronics engineering and currently doing what I love, designing awesome user experiences. I strongly think that design is all about making impossible <em>possible</em>. I dare to like meticulous design, modern typography, all sorts of electronic music and everything in between.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        I created a very popular WordPress theme named <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=journalist+theme" rel="nofollow">The Journalist</a>, I was interviewed by the Romanian version of <em>The Setup</em> named <a href="http://digerati.ro/lucian-marin" rel="nofollow">digerati</a>, I was featured on <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html" rel="nofollow">the official Google blog</a> for my work on their favicon, I have been part of team who wrote the <a href="/archive/i-wrote-a-book.html" class="follow">Newscoop 3 Cookbook</a>, I have been interviewed and published in <a href="/archive/an-iconic-book.html" class="follow">the Icon Handbook</a> about a peculiar project and I probably did other cool stuff that you may never hear about.
